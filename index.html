<h3><marquee>Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix (the end of the uterus)</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">



<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Noninfectious cervicitis causes include exposure to chemicals or mechanical irritation. These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Chemical irritation from spermicides or douches or the latex used in condoms.</li><li>
Reaction to diaphragms, cervical caps, tampons or pessaries inserted.</li><li>
Radiation therapy or systemic inflammatory diseases.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3 class="third">SYMPTOMS</h3>
<p>Cervicitis symptoms to watch for include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Abnormal vaginal discharge that may be yellow, white, or gray and have an unpleasant odor.</li><li>
Unexpected light vaginal bleeding.</li><li>
Painful sexual intercourse.</li><li>
Vulvar or vaginal irritation.

	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>Cervicitis can be diagnosed during a full pelvic exam. A Pap smear may also be performed. These tests allow your healthcare provider to analyze your cervical and uterine cells for abnormalities. Your provider will also take a sample of any vaginal discharge to test for infections â€“ such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis. During your appointment, your healthcare provider will check for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any redness on your cervix.</li><li>
Discharge.</li><li>

Blood on your vagina or cervix.</li><li>

Inflammation of the vaginal walls.

	</li>
</ul>



	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Cervicitis treatment usually includes antibiotics to eliminate any bacterial infections that may be causing the condition. People under age 25 or who engage in high-risk behaviors may be treated with antibiotics even if bacteria are not detected. (Some bacteria can be hard to detect but may still be present.)</p><p>

Antibiotics successfully treat cervicitis in most cases.</p>
